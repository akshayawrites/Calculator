Create a simple, classy calculator web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Design requirements:

Theme colors:

Primary: #866BBF, #8878BF, #7E72A6, #BFB8D9, #F2F2F2

Use a modern calculator-style font (like "Orbitron", "Digital-7", or similar digital display font).

The calculator should have a minimal, elegant, glassy UI with soft shadows and rounded corners.

Display area should be large and clean with right-aligned text.

Buttons should have hover effects and smooth animations (no harsh borders).

Keep it responsive and centered on the page.

Functional requirements:

Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %, and =

Clear (C) and Delete (⌫) buttons.

Should handle decimal numbers.

Display updates dynamically as you type.

Extras (optional but nice):

Light glow on hover for buttons.

Subtle gradient background using theme colors.

Animate button click (e.g. scale down slightly).

Make sure the result looks modern, clean, and professional, with a balanced color palette and readable UI.
Include all code (HTML, CSS, JS) in separate files.
